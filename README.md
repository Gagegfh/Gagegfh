- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gagegfh
- 👀 I’m interested in everything related to software, computers, information technology, and coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a concentration in Full Stack Programming/Python Visualization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all Python projects. I am open to learning and collaborating on anything else as well.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have served in the Marines for a decade and am excited to move on from that and start a career in Information Technology!
